; order of growth of the most frequent: O(N)
; the most frequent will run in linear time becuase it will check the symbols present in both the left
; and right branches at the top level, it will then immediately find that the most frequent symbol is directly on the top
; branch and then proceed there and find it 


; the order of growth of the least frequent will be: O( n + n-1 + n-2 ... 2)
