; the op should be both commutative and associative (i.e. you should be able to
; mess around with the order in which the elements are presented *and* evaluated)
; this is probably only achievable with an operation and seed value combo that
; allows the seed value to entirely dissapear into the first element, for instance
; 1 and multiplication or zero and addition
