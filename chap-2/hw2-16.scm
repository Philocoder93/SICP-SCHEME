; after doing some reading about other peoples answers to this question I can
; now say that my answers to the previous handfull of questions were mostly incorrect
; but had some glimmers of truth in them

; i thought that the answer had something to do with the number of multiplications
; and that's half true, really the answer is that it has to do with the number of divisions
; of an interval by itself, in algebra that always comes to one, however, when you are
; doing interval division that is not neccesarily the case, the answer there will only come
; to one if the variances of the intervals is zero, this explains why the two methods produce
; identical results when the variance of the given interval is zero and at no other time
