; bits required to encode the most common symbol is one obviously
; because the very first fork in this tree will have the most common symbol
; as one of it's branches and the rest of the tree on the other

; for the least will require n - 1 symbols to encode obviously

; all of this follows straightforwardly from the fact that in this tree each level of the tree will have precisely one branch on it
; except the last one which will have two,
; moreover, each branch will have a character of lower frequency than the one that was on the previous line
